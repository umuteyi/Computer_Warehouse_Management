# Computer_Warehouse_Management

In this project, a detailed research and development process was carried out about a computer warehouse system. Products consist of computer components such as a monitor, ram, CPU, etc. There are 49 different products in total. While building the warehouse system, main entities such as employees, orders, products, shipments, and customers were considered. Shipment is not covered by the warehouse company but an agreement has been made with another logistics company.

In order to solve the necessary warehouse problem, the problem was first defined in detail. Assumptions and possible constraints were determined. Then, in order to see the problem more clearly, the ER diagram was drawn and the business rules were determined. There are 10 entity tables in total and 2 of them are bridge tables. The tables are respectively employee, employee skill, skill, customer, orders, order details, product, product description, shipment, and shelf. The required attributes have been determined by their type and are detailed in the ER Diagram.

With the ER Diagram, coding was written over MySQL. While some data are directly inserted, some of them are added by importing via an Excel file. Procedure and trigger features are also used to add a new customer, employee, order to the database and to perform calculations such as order value, most valuable product, full shelves, etc. Data entry examples are given for the numerical example and the code is tested.
